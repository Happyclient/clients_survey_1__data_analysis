"The e-sim! @mtnug; following our discussion a few months ago where you stated 'limited demand' as a reason for not rolling out the e-sim, does Apple's elimination of this on the iPhone 14 create the desired demand? https://t.co/pwRcnaKdCh"

@Airtel_Ug How to send call back messages
@Airtel_Ug How many users does it connect and what's the power measure of the battery?
@Airtel_Ug Problem is that you label it monthly but it's not unlimited I've been in different countries something monthly don't get done in weeks what happens is reduction in speed but not totally used
@Airtel_Ug The rate at which your data is running is alarming
@Airtel_Ug Why don't you increase the minutes for freaky. The first 100 minutes could take us thru the weekend matching with the data. The 30 minutes only go for one day and that's today. Atleast you would have made them 50 minutes but imagine from 100 to 30. That was too much deduction.
@Airtel_Ug The way you consume our daily data....is the way fire 🔥 will consume you in hale U people am sorry for this but you should check out yrselves bino byansi.....how can I load data for a week and it works for a day and half 😫 🤔???? Anyway its not my father's bizness .

@Airtel_Ug You take our data like we don’t pay for it🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️! 9 gb went just after uploading a 30 min video!!! 9 GB??

Dear @Airtel_Ug why are you so annoying? Is it hard for you to introduce a mechanism where by a client is notified when his calls are about to get done so that his credit is not affected? Mtn has this in place why not you? Don’t you value customer feedback?
@Airtel_Ug I feel so bad how my airtime went from 100000 to 0 balance when my phone was on flight mode . I never used your internet nor make calls . Am very disappointed in you .

Airtel data kumanyoko tags @Airtel_Ug 😒 1gb gone in 20minutes after me turning off my data for other apps and leaving twitter and what’s app
@Airtel_Ug your complaint handling process is completely broken. We have experienced internet outage for sometime now but it’s like Airtel is unbothered about our plight. Yet they are not ashamed to invoice monthly for services not offered
@Airtel_Ug Iam abroad. Am in UAE  please help me I can provide all the information about me online I moved with my National ID

@Airtel_Ug Kindly would like to inquire what happened to the Friday to Monday midnight freaky Friday. ? And secondly your data flow rate is very high. Those are complaints @Airtel_Ug must consider other wise you will loose clients to competing mobile networks who offer a better data service
@Airtel_Ug Easy we can buy but @Airtel_Ug you over consume our bundles just in mere seconds you've used 90%💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭
@Airtel_Ug Just a waste of time with the way ur data flows in just a second and the data is used up
@Airtel_Ug Why do you put there a short expiration period?
@Airtel_Ug How comes i found his number already connected on tugabane.
"@Airtel_Ug we loaded a bundle on our router,broad band number 207805754 on the 8 September 2022 but it hasn't worked for even a minute. Either refund our money or give us the data bundle.Your system is rubbish"

"@Airtel_Ug Airtel how can u sell someone 9GB for 30mins and it expires where does it go after buying it.
Let's be honest."
Hello @Airtel_Ug I wonder why my network often goes to No service
"@Airtel_Ug , how comes my Airtel Money is still locked when it's now 5days. You had me 48hrs and now it's beyond 120hrs, my email and DM aren't responded to, neither customer service helpline 100 is attended to. Pick a leave from @mtnug? They immediately respond to customers."
"@Airtel_Ug @mtnug And I came and swapped, at the same time requested it to be unlocked.  Take note that TIME FACTOR is an important and valuable item. It's not a matter of moving to service center. I personally told them to unlock everything at the time I was replacing my simcard"
@Airtel_Ug Can I use tougabane in when am out of range I can still stay connected? Do we use the normal data packages as normal Mobile data packages? Am currently using the 50 GB package of 100.000/-.
Dear @Airtel_Ug how much is a pocket WiFi

"@UgandanLawyer @Jonekyoma @Airtel_Ug Airtel intentionally has been cheating Users by giving less Data than wat they quote and then pretend to be cheaper Bundles.
